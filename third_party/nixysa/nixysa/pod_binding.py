"""pod binding model module.

This module implements the glue functions for the pod binding model, that is
used by POD types, and strings (which are POD in JavaScript). 'void' is also
included here, although it is only used for return values (and raises an
exception otherwise).

In C++, objects using this binding model are passed and returned by value (or
by pointer when mutable), except strings which are passed by const reference
(and returned by copy).
For example:
void SetValues(int value, const string &name);
float GetValue();
string GetString();

For JS bindings, they are directly represented by variants.
