This sample is a simple example for the code generator.

To build:
- on Linux, just use 'scons' with the provided SConstruct. Install the built
  plugin into the plugins directory for your favorite browser. Then open
  test.html.
- on Windows, open the complex.sln solution, press F5. It should install the
  plug-in automatically, run Firefox, and load the sample page.

For details look into:
complex.h, that defines a simple C++ class for complex numbers.
complex.idl, that defines the API that is exposed to Javascript.
test.html, that shows an example usage of the generated plug-in.
